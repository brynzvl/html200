BROWSER TESTING

1. Chrome

On the home page, the logo and cart sections are hidden due to the image tag above it. I tried many different ways to move the image to the background but have been unsuccessful. The browser is loading responsive images based on the browser width.  The colors and most web copy and match the PDF. The nav links need to be bold and styled. The site responds nicely by changing layouts and omitting the right column as I play with the browser width and when I open the dev tool device emulator. Dog page had column issues that I resolved but its still not there yet. Blog page has wrapping text. I don't know if that is bad or good since we didn't have mock ups for that. Contact page still needs to be styled and fixed to be responsive bit more but all elements are present. 

2. Safari - The home page is very similar to the chrome version. Images (with the exception of the header), color and typography are displaying properly. The grid is not rendering appropriately in the smaller widths.   

3. Opera - Fonts seem lighter on and colors seem more vibrant in Opera. No other errors found.

4. Safari Mobile - Opened link on iPhone X. The site looks great on a small devices with Retina screens. The 3x of the images look great. There are style issues on "Dog" page. Contact still needs to be responsive.

5. Foxfire Focus - Firefox Focus blocked the prompt from the buttons. This is something to consider when building.
